# Haikhal Fakhreez - Self-taught Front-end Developer

Hi, Iâ€™m Haikhal. I create amazing websites that are responsive, beautiful, and easy to use.

I'm currently working on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** functionality for web browsers.

My GitHub repos are basically my drawing canvas. Feel free to take a look.
